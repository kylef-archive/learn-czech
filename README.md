## Alphabet

- j is pronounced like a ‘y’.
- á, é, í, ý, ú, ů are all long vowels.
- š, č are pronounced ‘sh’ and ‘ch’.
- c is pronounced ‘ts’ - like in ‘tsunami’.
- ň, ď, ť all have an imaginary Czech ‘j’ following them, and sound like ‘new’ and ‘due’ (not ‘noo’ or ‘doo’).
- ch sounds like the Scottish ch, like in ‘loch’.
- ř is a fun one! It’s usually explained as something like ‘rzh’, but the sound doesn’t actually exist in any other language.
- sh is pronounced as 2 distinct sound - ‘s’ then ‘h’, not like the English ‘sh’.
